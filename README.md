### Hello there! :grinning:

I am an M.Tech graduate student from the IIITDM, Kancheepuram. I’m highly interested in backend and server technologies and also love to solve problems in that domain. I work in Linux and am far more efficient in it compared to other platforms.

More about me? I generally checkout the latest technologies in open source and blogs regarding the tech giants. Most of my projects are based on performance improvisation, scalable and backend layers related to the Go programming language. I’m experienced in writing production level code in Golang, thanks to my previous internships in supporting me build my skills in it. I’m self motivated and try to learn new technologies, cloud platforms and programming languages to keep myself busy in the zone.

I also have a fair amount of experience in deploying applications on Heroku and GCP.
Checkout my repos below to know more about my projects and experience.
Ping me on my email ID to suggest work opportunites or for hire. I'm always looking forward to work with wonderful collaborators.
